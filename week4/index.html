    <p>
        Frame data is a count of the frames of animation of a given move of a character.
      If your thought is "that could be anything," then, you'd be right. Which is why
      the data itself is given some context through your games' frame rate. If your games
      runs at 60 frames a second, this means that means you can generally use that measurement to
      imagine the speed of a move.
        If I say a move is "12 frames," this tells you the move connects with the opponent in
        2/10ths of a second (or the move takes about 20% of a second) to hit your opponent.
        From the time you hit the button til the moment when that move can hit your opponent,
        those animation frames in specific are called "Startup frames."

        The move pictured here has 17 Startup frames, however, the game does not tell us the
        "active" or "recovery" frames of this move.
        (more on this info later...)
